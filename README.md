## Preparation:
Before using this plugin, you need to set up a Pinterest Client ID. Go to [Pinterest Dev Site](https://developers.pinterest.com/manage/), login and generate a client ID.

## Installation:
cordova plugins add https://github.com/realizedmobile/cordova-Pinterest.git

## Usage
The plugin creates the object `PinterestPlugin`

After onDeviceReady, you have to initialize Pinterest with your client ID before using it;
init takes 3 arguments;
	
	1)      clientID - a Pinterest Client ID
	1)	successHandler - a function that will be called on success
	2)	errorHandler - a function that will be called on error.

Example:
	PinterestPlugin.init("ClientID", successHandler, errorHandler);

To check if a version of the Pinterest app is installed, use canPinWidthSDK(). Currently, this feature only supports iOS, while on Android the Pinterest SDK will redirect users to the Google Play store if Pinterest is not available on their device.

canPinWithSDK takes 2 arguments;

	1)	successHandler - a function that will be called on success
	2)	errorHandler - a function that will be called on error.
	
Example:
	
	PinterestPlugin.canPinWithSDK(successHandler, errorHandler);

To pin, use pin()
pin takes 5 arguments;

	1)	sourceURL - the url the Pin will link to.
	2)	imageURL - the url of the image to Pin.
	3)	description - a suggested Pin description.
	4)	resultHandler - a function that will be called on success
	5)	errorHandler - a function that will be called on error.

Example:

	PinterestPlugin.pin("http://placekitten.com", "http://placekitten.com/500/400", "Test", successHandler, errorHandler);
